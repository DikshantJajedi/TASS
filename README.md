   The link for the installation of python is given below:
   https://www.python.org/downloads/

2.Installation of pycharm (optional)
  PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language. 
   Features:-
  (a)	Coding assistance and analysis, with code completion, syntax and error highlighting, quick fixes 
  (b)	Project and code navigation: specialized project views, file structure views and quick jumping between files, classes, methods and usages
  (c)Integrated Python debugger Integrated unit testing, with line-by-line code coverage
  (d) Google App Engine Python development 

   The installation of Pycharm is optional. We used it for easier and better debugging of the code. 
   Another advantage of using this was that we can  download any package of python directly from the IDE.
   Download link for pycharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

3. Install pip
   pip is the package installer for Python. You can use pip to install packages from the Python Package Index and other indexes.
   Download link for pip: https://pypi.org/project/pip/
